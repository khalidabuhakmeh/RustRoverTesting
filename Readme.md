## Unit and Integration Testing with RustRover

This is the sample code that accompanies [the blog post written for the RustRover blog](https://blog.jetbrains.com/rust/2024/04/02/rust-unit-and-integration-testing-in-rustrover/). 

Folks have asked if they can see the final project, and so it makes sense to push this up to a public repository.

Check out the blog post and [RustRover for your Rust ðŸ¦€ needs](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust).

Cheers,
